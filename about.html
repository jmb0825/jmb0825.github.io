					<p id = "about_par">I am currently going into my last year as an undergraduate computer science student at Arizona State University. In December of 2020, I will be graduating a semester early
					with with a concentration in cybersecurity. After that, I am currently planning to pursue a Master's degree through ASU's accelerated graduate program.</p>
					<p id = "about_par">I am studying to become a computer scientist because I enjoy solving problems, and almost every problem has a solution. I am confident in my ability
					to overcome challenges, and solve any problem given to me. I have recently added a cybersecurity concentration to my degree as I believe that the problem of protecting digtal information
					will become increasingly complex in the future.</p>
