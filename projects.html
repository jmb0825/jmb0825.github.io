					<span id="project_span">This website</span>
					<p id="project_par">Before creating this Portfolio website, I had not worked with HTML and CSS before. I had always wanted to create my own
					website, and have learned a lot so far. I am still learning more about HTML and CSS, so the site is not 100% complete yet. I am working on improving
					the appearance of the site as well as making it mobile compatible. You can see the source code on Github!</p>

					<span id="project_span"><a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/psyche/">NASA Psyche Mission</a> - Better Experiences for Students</span>
					<p id="project_par">For my Senior year capstone project, I am working with NASA and Arizona State University in order to develop a web-based system.
					This system will be designed to help students learn about and join available interdisciplinary capstone projects and to also post and search for 
					students with other skillsets needed to make their project a success. For more information about the Psyche Mission, click the link above.</p>

					<span id="project_span">Barrett Honors Project - Web Browser</span>
					<p id="project_par">Being a part of Barrett Honors College, I elected to complete an optional honors project.
					The goal of the project was to create a web browser using C# in Visual Studio, and then create services using the .NET Framework.
					I implemented different services, which were small games and tools, using ASP.NET and WCF .svc services. I then referenced those services in the web
					browser I had created. This was my first exposure to C# and .NET.</p>
					<span>To demo the browser and test the services, click the link below to download the executable.</span><br />

					<span id="project_span">Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm</span>
					<p id="project_par">This project completed in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. Using C++, I implemented Dijkstra's shortest
					path algorithm using a weighted, directed graph. In order to ensure O((|E|+|V|)log|V|) runtime, I implemented the min-heap data structure
					to be used as a priority queue. The program reads in a graph from a user supplied text file, and performs actions based on user commands.
					For more details and testing information, view the source code on Github.</p>

					<span id="project_span">To Do List</span>
					<p id="project_par">I created a virtual planner to keep track of homework, projects, and other tasks. Users can add tasks to the list and assign
					priorities to each different task. Each task is diplayed in order based on its assigned priority. Additionally, tasks can be marked as complete
					and deleted from the list altogether. This project was written in Java using Eclipse and JavaFX.</p><br />

					<hr>
					<span id="project_span">Min-heap data structure</span>
					<p id="project_par">I implemented the min-heap data structure to later be used in the Dijsktra's shortest path project. The program reads in
					numbers from an input file and then relies on user commands to sort the heap, add new elemtents, and delete elements. The user can print the
					heap content at any time to see how the elements have been sorted. View the code on Github to test the program.</p>
